This is the source code for a mini calculator which was for my first Visual Basic Assignment. 

Functionality required for this assignment included: 

1. Ability to add,subtract,divide,multiple.
2. Have three different text boxes, two so that the user could input numbers and the third to display an answer.
3. A clear function, to erase the contents of three text boxes.
